Was<br>very popular in school but didn't have internet <br>access at home during lockdowns. As a result<br>she was not included in her friends online<br>social lives, who continued socialising without<br>her. She now dreads going to school, as she<br>feels anxiety and panic. She feels behind her<br>peers and feels excluded and overwhelmed.                                                                                           | I would visit the site to get signposted<br>to other services and an organisation<br>where I can get counselling free as I'm<br>a student and can't afford counselling.<br><br>I would use the free version of the<br>Resonate App to help calm my thoughts<br>and get daily tips and positive<br>reinforcement content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 3       | Business | **Sound Bytes Record Productions**<br>The music industry has suffered greatly during<br>the Covid19 Lockdowns. Musicians were unable to<br>perform their usual gigs and lost out financially<br>as well as their inspiration and creativity was<br>reduced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | This website is exactly what we have been<br>looking for.<br>I would use it to be inspired and to<br>inspire other fellow musicians and help<br>those who developed anxiety to get back<br>into production as well as create music<br>to help "Soothe our Souls".<br><br>The App is customised for our musicians<br>to get inspirational content for song<br>writing and production, as well as <br>allowing uploads of soothing relaxing<br>musics that is a sample of what the <br>musician can do, and at the same time<br>help inspire each other and relieve<br>anxiety.                                   |
| 4       | Business | **Direct Demand Logistics**<br>During lockdowns our business became increasingly<br>busy. We had to hire more people, which is great!<br>But our employees suffered family losses due to <br>Covid19, and sadly some of them passed away.<br>This left families without income and struggling<br>anxiety which developed due to a combination of<br>factors: increased demand delivering=more hours<br>away from family, some not seeing family members<br>again due to them passing away while the employee<br>was away on a long-haul distribution job.  | We are grateful for the Resonate website<br>to be able to signpost us to free services<br>as well as give us tools and tips we can<br>use. <br><br>We have been able to provide our employees<br>with a bespoke App Resonate enterprise <br>version. This is geared towards helping<br>manage anxiety, alongside coping with<br>grief and we have also included a section<br>on budgeting and where they can apply for<br>loans or support grants, all within the<br>App.<br><br>We would use the Resonate App bespoke<br>version to assist with maintaining the <br>wellbeing of our staff and their families. |

3. Documentation including readme file, spec sheet, timeline for project stages. Estimated time 1 week.

4. Development strategy: Develop the first page and styles, that then will be used as a template for the rest of the site pages. Use mixins and variables with SCSS to compile to CSS, to avoid repetative coding.

*Changes from Mockup Design*:

1. Removed 'More' menu item and moved the more content into the about content. The More menu item became the 'Contact' menu item.


## Future Development:

1. Implement Voice Assistance / Voice Over for Assisted Technology

2. Feedback poll as an Enquiry Form with a radio button as a poll which allows the user to select if they have been battling with anxiety. And if yes, if it was worse before, during or after the lockdowns.

3. Further deployment to hosted subdomain name

**Feedback Form Plan:**

Name, Age, State/County, Country, Ethnicity, Have anxiety? Checkbox y/n, Getting support? Checkbox y/n, Anxiety Meter (radio buttons): Before pandemic 1 to 10, During pandemic 1 to 10, After pandemic 1 to 10, Now: 1 to 10.

# Acknowledgements

CSS Animations: Stackflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42632767/css-animation-grow-from-center-zoom-from-center-dot-to-full-container  - I used the code and edited by removing the staged % keyframes and also made it shrink instead of grow. For the flyIn one, I removed the inbetween keyframes and only had 2 to make the animation smoother.

# Debugging & Test Results

TEST CASES: https://github.com/wendybovill/milestone-project-one/blob/5a1e38a27c76930b66c9396deefb86231cd7ec39/Test_Cases.md

*Debugging:* Using devtools in chrome and safari. Corrected misaligned boxes with bootstrap. Resized font for smaller devices. Had to hide the large content boxes on the front page from showing in very small devices, and instead added sections with an image background. This is hidden from the users view on larger devices and they see the larger content boxes on the front page.

The logo was overlapping the navigation on smaller devices. I had to resize it for smaller devices, and change the position of the navigation, as well as make the padding for the hover view smaller so the highlight behind did not overlap the logo.

There were issues when first deployed to github pages, where the stylesheet and images did not show. This was corrected after consultation with my mentor Gaff, and the links were then corrected.

There were multiple issues trying to get the font awesome to show. No matter what css link I used. In the end the only one it accepted is a kit link for js.

W3 html validator found 2 attributes that needed to be separated by a space, and complained about the aria-labels I'd used as a violation so I changed them to titles to describe what the following section was about.

Jigsaw validator found some errors in the css and anmiations that were corrected.

Document of validation and errors can be viewed by clicking on the link below:
