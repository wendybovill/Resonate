        <h1 class="entry-title">About Anxiety</h1>
        <p class="entry-paragraph">It is normal to experience some anxiety sometimes in relation to life’s events and various circumstances, such as just before an exam or a job interview. However, some people get anxiety more often and these can be because of anxiety disorders where they frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations.<br><br>
            However these feelings can effect someone’s daily activities, and can be difficult to control, and are out of proportion to the actual danger and as well as they can last a long time. People with anxiety may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. This is where trying to find help to manage the anxiety is really important.<br><br>
            There are also lifes stressful events that can be a trigger for anxiety. One such recent well known even is the Covid19 Pandemic. This caused mass panic and fear globally of contracting the virus and becoming ill, or being unable to work or go to school during the lockdowns. This effected our social life and interactin with each other and confidence we usually have may have deteriorated. Peoples finances were also effected, causing some people to not have any income. Some people may have lost their homes being unable to keep up with mortgage payments. Many people lost loved ones they may have relied on for support. Overall as a result of Covid19 either directly or indirectly, anxiety was heightened during and after Covid19 pandemic.<br><br>
            Anxiety is a "hidden illness". This means that there are not always physcial visible signs that are obvious to others. But when it comes to treating anxiety, there are many options available, such as finding a therapist, using mindfulness apps, soothing sounds, and watching calming videos, or taking a walk in nature. Some options are free but many are not. We offer a free app to assist with managing your anxiety. Please see our <a href="tools.html" target="_self" title="click to go to our tools page">'Tools'</a> page for further information about this and other resources.</p>
