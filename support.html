        <p class="entry-paragraph">It&apos;s important to get support when you are feeling anxious. Sometimes that can just be chatting over things with a friend. But sometimes you may feel you need more support. There are organisations that can help, and different types of therapies that will help you put some tools into practice to manage your anxiety, so that it doesn&apos;t rob you of your daily activities.<br><br>
            If you need urgent help always call 999 if its an emergency. But otherwise there are talking services such as the Samaritans. Then there are mindfulness apps to help you stay calm. There are relaxing videos on Youtube, and also relaxing sounds you can listen to.<br><br>        
            But if you feel you are getting overwhelmed by anxiety on a regular basis, you may wish to speak to your GP, who can sign post you to some mental health services.</p>
